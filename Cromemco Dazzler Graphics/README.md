The Cromemco Dazzler graphics package includes functions such as Dazzler initialization, screen erase, line generation,
character generation, and point display. Several of these functions are based on a graphics standard proposed by
Dr. Vincent Jones. The functions are interfaced to Cromemco Fortran IV and 16K Extended Basic as well as being
fully relocatable for linking to assembly language programs. The graphics package also includes demonstration
graphics programs in Fortran and Basic that use the Dazzler display.
